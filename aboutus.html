            be activated once the information provided by the Customer is validated by BRB, who shall
            not be liable for any failure of the Customer not being approved a CASHMATE Cash Card due to
            the failure of the Customer to provide the required information.
            3. OWNERSHIP OF THE CASHMATE CASH CARD. The Customer’s registered information and valid
            identification presented are presumed to be correct, true and valid. The Customer shall be

          <p>
            4. RELEVANT CASHMATE CASH CARD FEES. The Customer agrees to pay fees, applicable taxes and
            other charges related to the use of the CASHMATE Cash Card, as provided by BRB, such as, but
            not
            limited to, ATM, Cashmate Tellering and POS withdrawal, balance inquiry, and loading fees.
            Fees
            and other charges shall be inclusive of all applicable Philippine taxes and shall be debited
            from the Customer’s Cash Card balance. The amount of fees and charges may be revised from
            time
            to time, as BRB may, in their absolute opinion, deem necessary. Please refer to the latest
            posted cash card fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. LOADING OF THE CASHMATE CASH CARD. The CASHMATE Cash card is reloadable upon purchase.
            The
            Customer must load a peso value onto the CASHMATE Cash Card prior to usage. Loading can be
            done
            at the BRB Head Office and Partner Agent Branches. The minimum allowable load amount is PHP
            100
            Per Customer, the aggregate load limit is PHP 100,000 per calendar month. The loading
            service
            fee will be deducted immediately from every successful loaded transaction amount. All load
            transactions shall be payable in cash. No other modes of payment such as checks shall be
            accepted for loading. The aggregate load limit per Customer/month is based on Bangko Sentral
            ng
            Pilipinas (BSP) Circular 649 (Guidelines Governing the Issuance of Electronic Money) and
            such
            other guidelines as may be issued by the BSP from time to time.

          </p>
          <p>
            6. REDEMPTION OF LOAD. The CASHMATE Cash Card may be redeemed at face value. It shall not
            earn
            interest, rewards and other similar incentives convertible to cash, nor can it be purchased
            at a
            discount.
          </p>
          <p>
            7. USE OF THE CASHMATE CASH CARD. You can use your CASHMATE Cash Card to withdraw cash from
            any
            BancNet ATM and POS Cash-out or purchase goods and services at any POS Terminal connected to
            BancNet.

          </p>
          <p>
            8. ATM CAPTURE. In the event that a non-personalized CASHMATE Cash Card is captured in any
            BancNet ATM, the card will not be returned but destroyed by the bank that captured it. This
            is a
            BancNet policy for unnamed CASHMATE Cash Cards. Hence, the Customer must report this
            immediately
            to the Customer Care Hotline, and he/she must buy a new CASHMATE Cash Card. Thereafter, the
            Customer shall call the hotline again to request for the transfer of the remaining load from
            the
            old Cash Card to the new one.
          </p>
          <p>
            9. ATM ISSUES – NO-CASH & SHORT-CASH DISPENSING. The Customer must report the incident/s of
            such
            withdrawals to the BRB Customer Care Hotline. BRB shall conduct an investigation based on
            the
            Customer’s report. If details of the report match BRB’s record of the transaction, the money
            shall be credited back to the Customer’s Cash Card account.

          </p>
          <p>
            10.TRANSACTION DISPUTE. The Customer or his/her representative must, at all times, ask for
            the
            confirmation receipt as proof of every successful transaction and as reference in case of a
            dispute.
          </p>
          <p>
            11.LOST OR STOLEN CARD. In the event that the CASHMATE Cash Card is lost or stolen, the loss
            or
            theft must be immediately reported by the Customer to BRB’s Customer Care Hotline (02)
            8478-6615, (02) 8478-6618 or (02) 8852-1454 and (Globe) 0916-6243607 (Smart) 0998-3268399.
            All
            transactions are considered valid prior to BRB’s receipt of advice of a card’s loss or
            theft,
            including, but not limited to, fraudulent transactions and/or forged signature. Blocking or
            cancellation of the CASHMATE Cash Card shall be processed only upon verbal notification,
            proper
            customer authentication and actual recording thereof by BRB.
          </p>
          <p>
            12.VALIDITY AND EXPIRY OF THE CASHMATE Cash Card. Unless earlier terminated by BRB, or
            voluntarily cancelled or returned by the Customer, the CASHMATE Cash Card shall be valid
            from
            the day of issuance up to the last day of the month indicated on the expiry date (MM/YY).
            There
            is no option for renewal of the Cash Card. Therefore, upon expiry, the Customer must
            purchase a
            new Cash Card to continue enjoying the CASHMATE Cash Card services. The Customer shall not
            use
            the Cash Card after its expiry date, cancellation, suspension, termination, withdrawal, or
            permit other persons to use the Cash Card for any reason whatsoever.
          </p>
          <p>
            13.DISHONOR OF CARD. The Customer agrees to hold BRB, its officers and employees, free and
